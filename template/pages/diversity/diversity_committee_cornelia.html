<p>
    Cornelia's PostgreSQL journey began in 2022 after nearly two decades in
    marketing across various industries.
</p>
<p>
    It took her over a year to have her first real encounter with the
    PostgreSQL community at conferences — and that's when everything changed.
    The sense of community captured her from day one, and she felt a strong
    urge to contribute to this great and vibrant ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, she has been focused on bridging the gap between technical
    depth and accessible, impactful communication.
</p>
<p>
    Today, Cornelia is proud to be part of the organizing team behind
    PostgreSQL conferences (e.g., PGDay Austria, PGConf.de), helping bring
    people together and keeping the spirit of open source collaboration
    alive. She is also involved in several other PostgreSQL-related
    initiatives with a strong community and inclusion focus.
